tracking_main.py

Main routine for tracking Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) across multiple timesteps.
Tracks are assigned via spatial overlap, and a robust filtering based on a lifting index (LI)
detection (provided in the detection results as 'lifting_index_regions') is applied.

The script returns per-timestep tracking arrays, main track IDs, lifetime arrays,
merging and splitting events, and tracking center positions.

    Tracks Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) and filters them based on a combined set of criteria.

    This function first tracks all detected precipitation features over time using spatial overlap,
    handling complex merging and splitting events. After the initial tracking, it performs a
    rigorous filtering step to identify "main MCSs". A track qualifies as a main MCS only if it
    contains a continuous period of at least 'main_lifetime_thresh' hours where, simultaneously,
    its area is greater than 'main_area_thresh' and it is in a convective environment (if 'use_li_filter' is True).

    The function returns three distinct sets of track IDs representing different levels of filtering,
    from the most restrictive ("in-phase" MCSs) to the most inclusive ("full family tree").

    Args:
        detection_results (List[dict]): A list where each dictionary represents one timestep and contains:
            - "final_labeled_regions" (np.ndarray): 2D array of detected cluster labels.
            - "lifting_index_regions" (np.ndarray): 2D binary array where 1 indicates a cluster met the LI criterion. Optional, used if 'use_li_filter' is True.
            - "center_points" (dict): Mapping of cluster label to its (lat, lon) center. Optional.
            - "time" (datetime.datetime): Timestamp for the data.
            - "lat2d" (np.ndarray): 2D array of latitudes.
            - "lon2d" (np.ndarray): 2D array of longitudes.
            - "lat" (np.ndarray): 1D array of latitudes.
            - "lon" (np.ndarray): 1D array of longitudes.
        main_lifetime_thresh (int): The minimum number of consecutive hours a track must simultaneously meet the area and LI criteria to be considered a main MCS.
        main_area_thresh (float): The minimum area (in km²) a track must have to be considered in its mature phase.
        grid_cell_area_km2 (float): The area of a single grid cell in km².
        nmaxmerge (int): The maximum number of parent systems to consider in a single merging event.
        use_li_filter (bool): If True, enables the convective environment check based on the "lifting_index_regions" data.

    Returns:
        Tuple: A tuple containing the following organized results:
            - robust_mcs_id (List[np.ndarray]): The most restrictive output. Contains track IDs only for the timesteps where the system is **simultaneously** larger than 'main_area_thresh' AND meets the convective LI criteria. This isolates the mature, "in-phase" portion of the MCSs.
            - main_mcs_id (List[np.ndarray]): Shows the **full lifetime** of all tracks that were identified as main MCSs. This includes their formation and dissipation stages where they may not meet the area or LI criteria.
            - main_mcs_id_merge_split (List[np.ndarray]): The most inclusive output. Shows the **full "family tree"**, containing the full lifetime of main MCSs plus the full lifetime of all smaller systems that merged into or split from them.
            - lifetime_list (List[np.ndarray]): A list of 2D arrays showing the pixel-wise lifetime (in timesteps) of all tracked clusters.
            - time_list (List[datetime.datetime]): A list of the timestamps corresponding to each frame.
            - lat2d (np.ndarray): A 2D array of latitude values.
            - lon2d (np.ndarray): A 2D array of longitude values.
            - lat (np.ndarray): A 1D array of latitude values.
            - lon (np.ndarray): A 1D array of longitude values.
            - merging_events (List[MergingEvent]): A list of all recorded merging events.
            - splitting_events (List[SplittingEvent]): A list of all recorded splitting events.
            - tracking_centers_list (List[dict]): A list of dictionaries, one for each timestep, mapping track IDs to their (lat, lon) center points."""
