    Resolves a merging scenario where multiple old track IDs map to a single new label.

        new_label (int): The new detection label that overlaps multiple old track IDs.
        old_track_ids (List[int]): The list of old track IDs that overlap this new label.
        merging_events (List[MergingEvent]): A list to record merging events.
        final_labeled_regions (numpy.ndarray): Current labeled regions.
        current_time (datetime.datetime): Timestamp for the merging event.
        max_area_dict (dict): Maps track ID -> max area encountered.
        grid_cell_area_km2 (float): Factor to convert pixel count to kmÂ².
        nmaxmerge (int, optional): Max number of merges recorded. Defaults to 5.
