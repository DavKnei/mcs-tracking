    A simpler “lowest‐label‐wins” approach to fix checkerboard patterns by

    For each labeled pixel (r, c):

      - If any neighbor has a smaller label M < L, and either cell's precipitation
        is >= threshold, unify label L -> M (lowest label wins).
    This repeats up to max_passes times or until no more unifications occur,
    eliminating checkerboard patches.

        threshold (float):

    Notes:
        - Because we unify L -> M if M < L, large clusters with smaller IDs can
          absorb neighboring clusters with bigger IDs if they share a boundary
          above the threshold.
        - In extreme cases, this can unify more than you want. Use with caution.
