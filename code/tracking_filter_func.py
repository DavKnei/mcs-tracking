    This function identifies all systems that are directly or indirectly connected
    to a 'main' MCS through merging or splitting events. It begins with the
    provided list of main MCS track IDs and iteratively searches for all parent
    systems that merged into them and all child systems that split from them.
    This process repeats to find the entire lineage (e.g., grandparents,
    grandchildren), ensuring that the complete history of all relevant convective
    elements is preserved.

    The final output is a series of 2D arrays where any track that is not
    part of this 'family tree' is removed (i.e., set to 0).

        merging_events (List[MergingEvent]): A list of all MergingEvent objects

            objects recorded during the tracking process.
